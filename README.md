# AutioEncoder
An experimental audio autoencoder.

# Overview
This project came out of the thought "I wonder if I could use an autoencoder to naively compress audio?".

`poc.py` contains the initial proof of concept code I used to see if a naive, simple autoencoder could even meaningfully preserve audio.
`encoder.py` contains the prototype compression routine I built after verifying some level of feasibility with my proof of concept.
